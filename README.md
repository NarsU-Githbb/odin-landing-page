My landing page project 

My objective is to create website that looks like your "average" website on the internet nowadays.

I'll be using this Odin Project lesson assignment Image One as my blueprint for the design:

I wish to demonstrate my css(flexbox) / other coding knowledge that I've learned so far with this project. 

(My next goal for this project is use it as a practice website for learning how to add/use some accessibility features & add CSS Media Queries to make the website presentable despite your  screen size. First I want to really get couple Javascript projects under my belt before going in deep into accessibility.)
