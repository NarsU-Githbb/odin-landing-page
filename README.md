My landing page project 

My objective is to create website that looks like your "average" website on the internet nowadays.

I'll be using this Odin Project lesson assignment Image One as my blueprint for the design:

I wish to demonstrate my css(flexbox) / other coding knowledge that I've learned so far with this project.
